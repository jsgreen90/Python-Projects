# Jupyter NoteBooks

These notebooks can be used for incident response investigations. I will also begin working on notebooks for information gathering as well as malware analysis. 

The incident response notebooks will be gathering information that was aggregated in Kusto and can be parsed/queried using two methods, both of which I will have frameworks for
  1. Azure-Kusto-Data library
  2. Kqlmagic library
